## 🏥 Hospital Patient Queue
**Overview:**  
A queue management system for hospitals where **emergency patients** are given priority over **regular patients**.  
Estimated wait time is displayed for each new patient.

- **Features:** Add patients, serve patients, estimate wait times.  
- **Data Structures Used:** Priority Queue (`heapq`) for emergencies, Normal Queue (`deque`) for regular patients.  
- **How it runs:** Run `hospital_queue.py` → Add patients → Serve patients in correct order.

## 📒 Contact Book
**Overview:**  
A contact management system that stores, searches, updates, and deletes contacts, while keeping them **alphabetically sorted**.  
Contacts are saved to a file for persistence.

- **Features:** Add, search, update, delete, display contacts.  
- **Data Structures Used:** Linked List (self-referential nodes), File storage (`pickle`).  
- **How it runs:** Run `contact_book.py` → Use menu to manage contacts → Data is saved in `contacts.dat`.

## 🧮 Expression Calculator
**Overview:**  
A calculator that evaluates **arithmetic expressions** by converting **infix to postfix** and then evaluating them using a stack.  

- **Features:** Infix to postfix conversion, expression evaluation, operator precedence handling.  
- **Data Structures Used:** Stack (Python list).  
- **How it runs:** Run `expression_calculator.py` → Enter expression → Program outputs postfix form and result.
